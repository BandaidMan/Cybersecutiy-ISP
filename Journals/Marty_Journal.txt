1: How to obtain proof that Philip A. Kocher is in possession of child pornography
	
	1 - Monitor his inbound and outbound Internet traffic at his ISP
	
	2 - Scan all emails he sends and receives, especially looking at attachments to those emails.
	
	3 - Be able to image his local storage and scan for associated files
	
	4 - Look for software to evade data identification such as TOR and VPN clients on his personal computer(s)

1: Data related to the email account @codermerlin
	
	1: Look at all inbound and outbound traffic from the codermerlin servers looking for encrypted data.
	
	2: Verify that codermerlin has a hosted email service
	
		2_1: If not hosted on codermerlin servers, where is it externally hosted from?

	3: See if any of the account’s emails has encrypted attachments

2: Decrypting emails received

	1: Examine type of encryption used in emails and attachments to those emails by looking at the headers
	
	2: Once determined the type of encryption used, look at possible vulnerabilities, exploits, or where keys to the encryption algorithm might be stored

3:Going through data under /usr/text/merlin

	1: There is a “Alice in Wonderland” Story, possible use of a One-Time Pad
	2: The other directory contains words for a dictionary brute force attack
	3: Finally, there is a URL, potentially the source of the downloaded dictionary.

	1: passwd file is readable, hash can be seen
	2: Write a script to use the dictionary file to generate hashes for each entry and check it
	3: Only possible has is MD5 B/C hash length in password file
	4: Writing in C++ because it will execute faster

1: The plan to use the su command to mimic logging in a mr kocher without alterting hm.

1: File is inaccessible as it only can be read by the user. That combined with the fact it is impossible to log in as mr kocher makes the only possible way to read the file be via exploiting some vulnerability in ubuntu. Something beyond my and aidan's skillset

UPDATE

2: The file is suddenly accessible, by looking at the file I ca determine it to contain exif data

3: After examining the text file in a HexD I see that it contains a similar header to a PNG file, after changing some data I can determine the file is going to Jordan.
